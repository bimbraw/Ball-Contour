# Ball-Contour

Code for single and multiple Ball Contour detection programmed using Python and using my laptop webcam.

Here are the two files - 
1. ball_contour_max - For one colored region. RGB values can be specified in the code.
2. ball_contour_multipe - For detecting multiple colored regions.
